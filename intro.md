# Introduction

Welcome to *FROM NEURON TO NARRATIVE*! 

This book is your hands-on guide to understanding and coding the essential foundations of neural networks without hiding behind libraries or pre-built frameworks.

### Why Build from Scratch?

Most learners begin their AI journey with frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras. These tools are powerful—but they can also obscure the inner workings of neural networks. By constructing everything yourself, you:

* **Master the fundamentals**: you’ll understand precisely how data flows through neurons, how activations work, and how backpropagation adjusts weights.
* **Build stronger intuition**: you won’t just run code—you'll derive the math, implement it, and visualize what’s happening in each layer.
* **Become a confident creator**: knowing what’s happening under the hood empowers you to innovate, experiment, and debug with real insight.

### What This Book Covers

The content is divided into four parts, each focusing on a critical architecture and its conceptual underpinnings:

1. **Artificial Neural Networks** - Start with the basics: how individual neurons aggregate inputs, apply activation functions, measure loss, and train using backpropagation and gradient descent.
2. **Neural Network Framework** - Learn to build a lightweight framework from scratch that cleanly encapsulates layers, forward passes, backpropagation, and common utilities like optimizers and loss functions.
3. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** - Explore the architecture that brought breakthroughs in image recognition: convolution, pooling, feature maps, and training deep CNNs—all written by you.
4. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** - Grasp models suited for sequential data through your own implementation of RNNs, along with LSTM and GRU variants to address learning long-term dependencies.

### How to Use This Book

* **Start simple and build up**: We begin with basic code and progressively introduce abstractions to keep complexity manageable.
* **Python-first learning**: Each concept is demonstrated first in pure Python, then optimized with NumPy for performance and clarity.
* **Learn by doing**: After each chapter, optional exercises encourage you to push further—experiment with activation functions, implement different optimizers, or apply your network to real data.
* **Bridge theory and practice**: You’ll see not just *what* to code—but *why*. Key mathematical concepts like chain rule, matrix operations, and convolution will be explained alongside the code.

### Who This Book Is For

This book is perfect for you if you:

* Are comfortable with Python and basic programming.
* Have little or no prior experience with neural networks.
* Want to build a deep, intuitive understanding of how neural networks work—from neurons to frameworks to convolutional and recurrent architectures.

By the end of this journey, you'll have the skills to code your own neural network architectures, understand their behavior, and be ready to dive into more advanced tools—or create your own.

Now… get ready to code your first neuron!
